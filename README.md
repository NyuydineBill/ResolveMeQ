## üìò Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement

A substantial portion (30‚Äì50%) of IT helpdesk tickets are repetitive and low-value (e.g., password resets, VPN issues, software installation). These consume valuable Tier-1 support time and delay responses to complex issues.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution

We introduce **Resolve Me, Quickly**, an AI-powered IT Helpdesk Agent that:

- Instantly resolves routine IT issues via chat or voice interfaces.
- Escalates complex issues to human agents with complete context and logs.
- Learns from past interactions to improve accuracy and resolution speed over time.

### 1.3 Key Benefits

| Stakeholder | Benefits |
|-------------|----------|
| **Employees** | 24/7 instant IT support for common issues. |
| **IT Teams** | Reduced repetitive tickets by 40%+, focus on strategic work. |
| **Organizations** | Lower support costs and improved efficiency. |
